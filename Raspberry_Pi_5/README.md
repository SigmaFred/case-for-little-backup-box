# Case for Raspberry Pi 5!
It uses the orignal Raspberry Pi Active Cooler and is a few millimeters flatter than the Raspberry 4 case.
Because of the fan, the space inside is very limited. Highly felxible silicone cables can help a lot!

The actual case uses all the other components of the RPi 4 version, excepted the fan.

## Variant for using an integrated NVMe SSD !!! UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DO NOT PRINT YET !!!
**Unfortunately, the "Pimoroni NVMe Base for Raspberry Pi 5" is slightly larger than the Raspberry Pi 5. The design therefore will not work using this case!** \
Next try will be the <a href="https://geekworm.com/products/x1002">Geekworm X1002</a>.

<!--If an SSD expansion is to be integrated, only the bottom of the housing needs to be replaced. This will be some 10 mm higher than the standard. In addition, four spacer sleeves "lbb-case RPi5-NVMe_dist_print_4x.stl" are required for assembly. These define the distance between the Raspberry Pi 5 and the NVMe Base.-->
