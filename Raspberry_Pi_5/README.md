# Case for Raspberry Pi 5!
It uses the orignal Raspberry Pi Active Cooler and is a few millimeters flatter than the Raspberry 4 case.
Because of the fan, the space inside is very limited. Highly felxible silicone cables can help a lot!

The actual case uses all the other components of the RPi 4 version, excepted the fan.

## Variant for using an integrated NVMe SSD !!! UNDER CONSTRUCTION !!!
**Unfortunately, the "Pimoroni NVMe Base for Raspberry Pi 5" is slightly larger than the Raspberry Pi 5. The design therefore does not work at the moment!** \
If an SSD expansion like the <a href="https://learn.pimoroni.com/article/getting-started-with-nvme-base">Pimoroni NVMe Base for Raspberry Pi 5</a> is to be integrated, only the bottom of the housing needs to be replaced. This is almost 9mm higher than the standard. In addition, four spacer sleeves "lbb-case RPi5-NVMe_dist_print_4x.stl" are required for assembly. These define the distance between the Raspberry Pi 5 and the NVMe Base.
