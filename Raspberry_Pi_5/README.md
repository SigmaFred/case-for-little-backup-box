# Case for Raspberry Pi 5!
It uses the orignal Raspberry Pi Active Cooler and is a few millimeters flatter than the Raspberry 4 case.
Because of the fan, the space inside is very limited. Highly felxible silicone cables can help a lot!

The actual case uses all the other components of the RPi 4 version, excepted the fan.
