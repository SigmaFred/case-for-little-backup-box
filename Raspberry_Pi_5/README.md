# This case is not finally tested yet!
It uses the orignal Raspberry Pi Active Cooler and is a few millimeters flatter than the Raspberry 4 case.
However, this housing has not yet been tested fully equipped with buttons and a display. This will follow shortly.
Please report any problems about it!

The actual case uses all the other components of the RPi 4 version.
