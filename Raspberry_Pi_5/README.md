# Case for Raspberry Pi 5!
It uses the orignal Raspberry Pi Active Cooler and is a few millimeters flatter than the Raspberry 4 case.
Because of the fan, the space inside is very limited. Highly felxible silicone cables can help a lot!

The actual case uses all the other components of the RPi 4 version, excepted the fan.

## Variant for using an integrated NVMe SSD
If an SSD expansion is to be integrated, only the bottom of the housing needs to be replaced. This will be some 10 mm higher than the standard.

After modifications <a href="https://geekworm.com/products/x1002">Geekworm X1002</a> can be used. But it needs to be modified:
- Field 2280 does not contain any lines. It needs to be shortened otherwise the board would be longer than the Pi. However, this means that SSDs of size 2280 can no longer be used
- The four mounting threads that are used to attach the Raspberry Pi must be drilled out to 2.5 mm.

Additional material for attaching the M.2 SSD to the board: \
1 screw 6mm  M2.5 (or M2.0) \
2 nuts M2.5 (or M2.0)

For the case:
4 screws M2.5 x 30 mm (replacing the M2.5 x 20 mm of the standard case)
